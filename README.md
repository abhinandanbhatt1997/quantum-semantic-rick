# 🧠 Quantum NLP: Spam in Superposition

> *“I encoded human language into qubits... and the universe called it spam.”* – Rick Sanchez

## 🚀 What the Hell Is This?

This is a **quantum-classical hybrid spam classifier**.  
Yeah, you heard that right.  
I took boring human emails, encoded them into **quantum circuits**, and let qubits collapse reality into "**SPAM**" or "**HAM**".

Not because it was needed.  
Because it was **inevitable**.

## 🧬 What’s Going On Here?

- 🔢 **Step 1: Bag of Words**  
  Tokenize email text like a peasant. Extract presence of words like “FREE,” “iPhone,” and “OK?” — whatever junk makes Gmail sweat.

- ⚛️ **Step 2: Quantum Encoding**  
  Each word presence is rotated into a qubit using **`Ry(θ)`** gates.  
  You think that’s overkill? I think your Naive Bayes model is pathetic.

- 🧠 **Step 3: Bitstring Measurements**  
  Run the circuits, collapse the superposition, and extract **bitstrings** that carry the truth — or at least the quantum illusion of it.

- 🌲 **Step 4: Classical Classifier**  
  Use RandomForest or whatever classical toy you prefer to classify the bitstrings.  
  Spoiler: it works.

## 🤖 What’s Next?

We’re replacing Bag-of-Words with **Flan-T5 sentence embeddings**.  
Because you haven’t truly tortured a language model until you’ve entangled its attention heads with a quantum circuit.

## 🧨 Warning

> Touch my code and collapse.  
> That’s not a threat. That’s how advanced this shit is.
